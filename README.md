# Marvel Names

Learning How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library

This [@scoped]package will return a random Marvel character name or an array of random names

I used the egghead.io guide here: https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library

The names were taken from here: https://http://marvel.com/comics/characters
